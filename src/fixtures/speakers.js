    lecture: 'Positive higher curvature and rational points',
    abstract: 'I will prove existence and height bounds for rational points of projective specializations with vanishing elementary obstruction of smooth varieties when the field is a function field of a complex surface (de Jong - He - S), a function field of a curve over a finite field (Xu - S), a sufficiently large p-adic field, a function field of a curve over a "nice" PAC field, etc., and the smooth variety has positive "higher curvature" (i.e., it is rationally simply connected ), e.g., 2-Fano complete intersections in projective space, projective homogeneous varieties (Yi Zhu), low degree hypersurfaces in Grassmannians (Rob Findley), etc.  This leads to uniform proofs and height bounds for the Brauer-Hasse-Noether theorem, the Tsen-Lang theorem, the split case of Harder\'s Theorem / Serre\'s "Conjecture II", etc.'
